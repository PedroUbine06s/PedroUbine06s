# Hello, I'm PedroUbine06s
 
## About Me
I am an aspiring full-stack developer currently working as an intern. 
I am passionate about building scalable and robust applications using NestJS on the backend and Angular on the frontend.

## Technologies I Work With ðŸ˜¼ 
- **NestJS**:  A powerful Node.js framework for efficient and reliable server-side applications.
- **Angular**: A popular frontend framework for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Rust Study ðŸ¦€
I am currently studying Rust to expand my programming skills and explore its applications in systems programming, high-performance computing, and more. I find Rust fascinating due to its focus on memory safety, concurrency, and performance optimizations.

## What You'll Find in My Repositories
In my GitHub repositories, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and growth as a full-stack developer. I have worked extensively with NestJS to build RESTful APIs and backend services. Additionally, I have gained experience in frontend development using Angular to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
